# Description

### Overview

With the constant developments taking place in Vancouver, crime rates and their patterns have been changing over the last few years. If we could understand how these patterns have changed in the past, then we could gain insight into patterns of crime that could occur in the future. This could be especially useful for those who are exploring neighborhoods when purchasing property, or those who want to determine if their office would be safer to take public transit to rather than car or bicycle given a high-theft area. To address this challenge, we propose a data visualization that allows current or prospective Vancouver residents to visually explore a dataset of crimes in Vancouver from 2003 to 2017. Our app shows the overall crime trend in Vancouver, as well as common types of crime that occur. Users are able to filter crimes based on a selected year range, and see how their distributions differ across distinct regions in Vancouver. In addition, information on which neighborhoods rank the highest in a category of crime, depending on time of day and broken down by blocks within each neighborhood, is easy to see with our visualization.



### Data

The dataset can be accessed via or https://www.kaggle.com/wosaku/crime-in-vancouver. It contains two csv files, but we will only be using ‘crime.csv’.
